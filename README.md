# Checking Repeatable Read Consistency for Galera Cluster / MariaDB

The whole Galera Cluster environment is established on Emulab.
` MariaDB version == 10.4.22
Galera Cluster version == 26.4.9`

### Run [setup_server_node.sh](./setup_server_node.sh) and [setup_client_node.sh](./setup_client_node.sh) to set up Galera on server and client nodes respectively.

For three server nodes, change the `cluster_name` and `server_ip` in the script. Then run

  `sh setup_server_node.sh <server_node_no>`

For the client nodes, run

  `sh setup_client_node.sh <server_ip_address>`
  
### Run [init.sh](./init.sh) to initialize the Database in Galera Cluster.

Need to change the parameter `key` if you want to customize the key number.

  `python3 init.py <server_ip_address>`

### Run  [galera.py](./galera.py) to generate transaction workloads. 

Please make sure the `server_id` are correct, and the `key_num` is same with settings in `init.py`. Then run

`python3 galera.py -w <wo_rate> -r <ro_rate> -p <w_percent> -t <trans_num> -o <op_num> -c <client_num> -n <thread_no> -f <folder_num>`

The collected traces will be stored in folder `output/folder_num/` where the trace for each client will be stored in a separate txt file; The default `folder_num` is 0.

### Run [group_data.py](./group_data.py) to normalize the collected data into one file result.txt.

Please make sure the `ops_per_trans` is same with `operation_num` in `galera.py`.

### Run [check_rr.py](./check_rr.py) to check if the execution run violates Repeatable Read consistency.

The given data in folder [output/0/](./output/0/) was generated by Galera engineer from a single MariaDB node, with Galera replication disabled. It violates `Property Four` defined in this script. The parameters are:

  20 keys, 10 clients, 100 transactions per client, 25 operations per transaction
  
### Run [multi_threads.sh](./multi_threads.sh) to automatically generate workloads.

Please change all the parameters regarding `ip_address`.
